this project is the first step towards building a full web application of the AirBnB clone. In this first step we are building a console, a custom command interpreter that will be used in subsequent AirBnB projects to manage objects of our classes.

This console will allow us to do the following:

Create a new object
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
